The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H4 (5.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients.

To install IMP, you need to install Horde first. See
https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/master/horde/docs/INSTALL for details. Once
Horde is installed, you can install IMP with the following command:

  pear install horde/imp

Then log in to Horde with your adminstrator account to configure the
application and install the database schema from the configuration interface.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0-RC2) are:

    * Improved new mail notifications, now available in all applications.
    * Improved alarm notifications in dynamic view.
    * Many small bugfixes and improvements.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H3 (4.3) are:

    * Updated for Horde 4.
    * All interfaces in a single application.
    * New mobile frontend.
    * Much improved AJAX frontend including a vertical pane layout.
    * New IMAP library written from scratch with broad RFC support and huge
      performance improvements.
    * More powerful search and filter functionality.
    * Smart-reply feature.
    * Improved new mail notifications.
    * Localized special folders.
    * Better display of HTML messages.
    * HTML signatures.
    * Draft auto-saving.
    * Support for custom IMAP flags.
    * Reduced memory usage.
