The Horde Team is pleased to announce the third beta release of the Internet
Mail Program (IMP) version H5 (6.2.0).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides dynamic, mobile, basic, and
minimal interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop
email clients. For more information on IMP, visit
http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems.  This
version is considered feature complete but there might still be a few bugs.
You should not use this preview version over existing production data.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

For upgrading instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/imp/docs/UPGRADING

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/imp/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to IMP version H5 (6.2.0beta2) are:
    * Folder list optimizations.
    * Small bug fixes and improvements.
