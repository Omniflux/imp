The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H4 (5.0.23).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides Ajax, mobile and traditional
interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop email
clients. For more information on IMP, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/imp.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H4 (5.0.22) are:
    * Better description of error in some permission denied error messages.
    * Compose window now closes properly after message redirection.
    * More efficient determination of when to use Ajax auto-completion.
