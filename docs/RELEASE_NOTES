The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Internet Mail
Program (IMP) version H5 (6.1.8).

IMP, the Internet Mail Program, is one of the most popular and widely deployed
open source webmail applications in the world. It allows universal, web-based
access to IMAP and POP3 mail servers and provides dynamic, mobile, basic, and
minimal interfaces with a rich range of features normally found only in desktop
email clients. For more information on IMP, visit

The major changes compared to IMP version H5 (6.1.7) are:
