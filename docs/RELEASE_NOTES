The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the IMP
Webmail Client version H3 (4.2).

IMP, the Internet Messaging Program, is one of the most popular webmail
applications available.  It allows universal, web-based access to IMAP and
POP3 mail servers and provides a full range of features normally found only in
desktop email clients.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production systems. This
version is considered feature complete but a few bugs may still exist in the
code.

We encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing lists or our bug
tracking system.  Updated translations are very welcome, though some strings
might still change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the IMP version H3 (4.2-ALPHA) are:
    * Further improved performance and caching.
    * Allow to strip all attachments at once.
    * Improved search screen.
    * Further bugfixes and improvements.
